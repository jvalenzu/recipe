# Japanese Curry

Not 100% sure where I got it from originally but I think it was https://norecipes.com/japanese-curry-recipe-from-scratch/

Serves about 4.  I like to serve over sticky noodles, rice also works.

## For the pre-curry
* 2 tsp oil
* large onion, diced
* 1 cup baby carrots, cut into chunks
* 1 lb. Yukon gold potatoes, skinned and cut into chunks
* 1 apple, pureed
* 2 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp garam masala
* 1/2 cup peas
* 15oz can garbanzo beans, rinsed
* 4 cups water

## For the roux
* 3 tbsp. butter
* 1/4 cup flour
* 2 tbsp. garam masala
* 1 tbsp. ketchup
* 1 tbsp. vegan Worcestershire sauce (most aren't, look out!)

## PRE-CURRY STEPS
* briefly microwave potatoes (maybe 5 minutes).  The goal here is not to cook them but just soften them up a little.  Don't overdo it!  Undercooked potatoes will have an opportunity to soften while simmering, but overcooked potatoes you will have to throw out because that gluey stuff is gross
* briefly microwave the carrots (maybe 90 seconds), similar logic
* heat the oil in large saucepan over medium low heat and add the onions.  Saut√© the onions until they're golden brown, stirring consistently.  turn heat to high, add garbanzo beans and lightly brown them.  It's okay if the onions get a little burned but I'd try to avoid it
* add water and carrots, bring to a boil
* lower heat to medium and add potatoes, pureed apple, salt, garam masala
* simmer for 30 minutes or until you can pass a fork through the carrots and potatoes

## ROUX STEPS
* melt the butter over medium-low heat
* add flour and garam masala, combining a fork until you have a thick paste
* add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and combine
* continue to cook until the paste starts crumbling
* remove from heat and set aside until curry is ready

## CURRY
* combine roux with 1 cup of water and mix vigorously.  I use a mixer to avoid any chunks.  It should be more a uniform paste at this point. 
* add roux and 1 cup water to pre-curry pot.
* Stir gently and add peas and heat through.
* simmer until you get the desired consistency.  Add water if necessary
